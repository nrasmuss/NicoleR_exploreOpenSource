This repository was created during the Girls Who Code College Loops Explore Open Source Challenge.

This project is part of the Explore Open Source Challenge through Girls Who Code and College Loops. In this challenge, we responded to the following prompt:

Delilah is a self-starter, and she created an app to get young girls excited about learning technology. Many kids have already tested the app, and she has been getting very positive reviews.

Since Delilah sourced most of her user-testers through her network, their backgrounds are all very similar to hers. Delilah wants her app to be more inclusive, but she doesn’t know how to find and approach more potential user-testers from underrepresented minorities. What can be some first steps?

My response to the prompt is below:
1. change the photos in the app (ex: robotics event such as FIRST publish their event photos online if worried about unrealistic photos)
2. reach out to additional test users via clubs geared towards young girls - promote STEM while gaining young test users!

Feedback:
- I like the idea of showing photos from events, but I feel like it’s a double-edged sword because if the event has a diversity problem then the photos can portray an unwelcoming atmosphere
- Finding groups that champion the experiences of identities you hope to reach is great, if you don’t know something, educate yourself and connect with someone who does!
- Love the double win of accessing new users and being more inclusive/representational at the same time
